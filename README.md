**TWO LINE ELEMENT READER**

Where supplied with NORAD Two-Line-Element (TLE) files and the GPS location of a sensor the Java code tracks the orbit of space objects from the earth. This therefore is an orbit tracking tool. This tool was initially developed during my tenure at the Australian National Universitiy's in the  Research School of Astrophysics and Astronomy. Last update to this tool was in Feburary of 2023.
